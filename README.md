# Password-Generator

Feel free to edit, learn, improve.
Do not download and then claim its yours, if you havnt changed anything major.

Compile the pgen.cpp for universal compatibility.

Linux64 is only for Mac and Linux. Not recommended for mac since it may not be compiled the same.

Reason: Cleaner code, colorized aswell.

I also do not recommend going above reasonable digits and times you generate a password.
If you wish to do so, then i would recommend changing the unsigned char into a string.
You would also haft to change the format of the array.

Directions: Open your terminal. Go to your directory where you have my generator in.
Then do "./Linux64" If this doesnt work then double check if you have renamed it to something else.
